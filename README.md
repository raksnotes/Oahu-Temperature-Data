# Oahu Temperature Data
Summary Statistics for the months of June and December 

Side Note: For the extract function, in Step 2, I had used sqlalchemy documentation as a reference. The reference link is at the bottom of this README. 

## Purpose: The purpose of this analysis is to retrieve data and generate summary statistics for temperature in Oahu, for the months of June and December

## Results: 
* The average temperature for the month of June is approximately 75 degrees 
* The average temperature for the month of December is 71 degrees 
* Tourists may be more likely to visit in June due to hotter temperatures 

## Summary: 
## With hotter weather, it would probably be more likely to rain as well. Perhaps writing a query that would determine if the weather is rainy or sunny, would be 
## helpful to know. Additionally, a query can be written to calculate the chance of rain where the shops are located specifically.
